# Kalman-filtering

Kalman filtering is a mathematical method used for estimating the state of a dynamic system from a series of noisy and incomplete measurements. It is widely used in fields such as control theory, navigation, robotics, and signal processing. The Kalman filter combines a prediction of the system's next state with new measurements to improve the accuracy of state estimation over time.

#The Kalman filter operates in two phases:
Prediction: In the prediction phase, the filter estimates the state at the next time step based on the previous state and the process model. It also predicts the uncertainty (covariance).
Correction: After receiving a new measurement, the filter updates the predicted state with the new data, adjusting the estimate based on the measurementâ€™s noise and the system's process model.

Key Benefits of Kalman Filtering:
Optimal Estimation: If the system dynamics and noise are Gaussian, the Kalman filter provides the best possible estimate in terms of minimizing the error covariance.
Recursive: The Kalman filter can process data sequentially, making it efficient for real-time applications. It does not need to store all past data but instead uses the most recent estimate and the new measurement.
Handling Uncertainty: It effectively handles noisy measurements and dynamic systems with uncertainties, making it ideal for tracking, sensor fusion, and navigation.

Example Applications:
Navigation Systems: In GPS or INS (Inertial Navigation Systems), Kalman filtering is used to combine the outputs from different sensors (like accelerometers and gyroscopes) to estimate the position, velocity, and orientation of a moving object.
Robotics: In robot localization, the Kalman filter is used to estimate the position and velocity of a robot based on noisy sensor data.
Signal Processing: The Kalman filter is used to remove noise from a signal, such as in speech recognition or financial time series forecasting.
